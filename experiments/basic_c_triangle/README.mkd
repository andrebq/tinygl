# What is this

This is just a basic sample that uses glfw and opengl to render a triangle on the screen.

You can't do too much with it, just check if everything is installed and the build system can find the required libs.

# LICENSE

This code is based on the examples code found at the GLFW release. See COPYING.txt for information of the GLFW license.
